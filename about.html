      <p>
        George Kusunoki Miller (ジョージ・楠木・ミラー, Jōji Kusunoki Mirā, born
        18 September 1992), better known by his stage name Joji and formerly by
        his online aliases Filthy Frank and Pink Guy, is a Japanese singer,
        songwriter, comedian, and a former Internet personality and YouTuber.
        Miller began his career as an entertainer through his many now-defunct
        YouTube channels, the most popular of these being TVFilthyFrank. They
        consisted of rap songs, rants, extreme challenges, ukulele performances,
        and a shock humor show titled The Filthy Frank Show. Most of the main
        characters, including the titular character of Filthy Frank, were played
        by Miller himself. To complement his TVFilthyFrank channel, Miller
        produced comedy hip hop music under his Pink Guy alias, who is also a
        zentai-wearing recurring character on The Filthy Frank Show, with his
        songs featured on the show and his discography spanning two full-length
        projects and an extended play. Miller's videos had widespread impact,
        including starting a viral dance craze known as the Harlem Shake, which
        was directly responsible for the debut of Baauer's "Harlem Shake" song
        atop the Billboard Hot 100. Many YouTube personalities made major or
        cameo appearances on The Filthy Frank Show, including h3h3Productions,
        iDubbbz, JonTron, jacksfilms, Michael Stevens, and
        PewDiePie.[non-primary source needed] In December 2017, Miller stated he
        had retired the channel to focus on his music career, under the name
        Joji, producing more nuanced and serious music, releasing the EP In
        Tongues, which peaked at number 58 on the Billboard 200, and his debut
        studio album Ballads 1, which reached number 1 on Billboard's Top
        R&B/Hip-Hop Albums in November 2018. With this, Miller became the first
        Asian-born artist to do so. He released his subsequent album, Nectar, in
        2020. Miller's music has been described as a mix between R&B, lo-fi and
        trip hop.

        Joji's music has been described as trip hop and lo-fi that blends
        elements of trap, folk, electronic, and R&B. His songs have been
        characterized as having "down tempo, melancholic themes and soulful
        vocals" with "minimalistic production". Joji himself classifies his work
        as dark love songs, with his 2020 album, Nectar, dissecting cliché
        tropes and topics. He has been compared to electronic artist James
        Blake, whom he also names as an influence alongside Radiohead, Shlohmo
        and Donald Glover. In an interview with Pigeons and Planes, Miller said
        that his music was inspired by his time growing up in Osaka and by boom
        bap instrumentals he listened to while attending Canadian Academy.
